            <h3>a. Coral bleaching</h3>
            <p>The threat of coral bleaching on a global scale is
a growing concern both because of the reduction in essential ecological
services provided by zooxanthellae (symbiotic algae) containing corals
within reef communities, and the potentially devastating economic
impacts of their demise. Coral bleaching is the largest natural cause
of coral death. During the 1997-1998 El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO), 16% of the world's coral reefs died. <br />
            <br />
My current research aims to unravel the causes of the physiological
causation of coral bleaching and the evolutionary and ecological impact
of these processes on corals and reefs respectively.&nbsp; We have
revealed (Tchernov et al. 2004) that the resilient clones of
zooxanthellae show a genetically encoded adaptation to higher
temperatures, resulting from changes in the lipid composition in the
thylakoids that confer resistance to elevated temperature stress. </p>
            <p>In addition, we are currently studying the
response of coral tissue under thermal stress, and have found that the
coral goes through programmed cell death (PCD). Interestingly, some
corals, which proved to be resilient to thermal stress, are capable of
biochemically inhibiting PCD (publication pending).&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The coevolution (if indeed a reciprocal
evolutionary change in interacting species has occurred) of
scleractinian corals and zooxanthellae started as early as the Norian
period (A sub-division of the late Triassic period, from 220.7 to 209.6
Ma.), however, very little is known about the evolutionary mechanism
that led to the formation of this symbiosis and to the conditions that
maintained it for such a long period.&nbsp; This leads to major
questions, such as 1) Perhaps coral bleaching is just a selective
mechanism that is an integral part of algae-coral coevolution? And 2)
On the other hand, coral bleaching might be a consequence of the latest
climatic changes brought about by anthropogenic activity?</p>
            <p>I am currently developing a new paleo-proxy that
could shed light on past bleaching events, through the detection of
Boron 11 isotopes in the coral skeleton. This paleo-proxy coupled with
Sr/Ca ratios and 14C or 230Th-234U-238U isotopic compositions may
indicate the time, temperature, and severity of such events in the
past. Such a proxy will create a new way to validate or dismiss any of
the current hypotheses. Moreover, it would be possible to determine if
during the last 150 years, the frequency of bleaching events is
increasing, and what the occurrence rate of bleaching was during
previous interglacial periods.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to
bleaching, we are experiencing an acidification effect that is derived
from the increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere over the past
150 years.</p>
            <h3><strong>b. Ocean Acidification and its
affect on Corals and Phytoplankton</strong></h3>
            <p>In addition to bleaching, we are experiencing an
acidification effect that is derived from the increased CO2
concentration in the atmosphere over the past 150 years.&nbsp; It
is important to understand how this phenomenon is affecting the
inhabitants of the marine realm.&nbsp; In our current research
(Fine and Tchernov 2007), we have discovered that corals can withstand
low pH values (7.2-7.4 versus modern value 8.2).&nbsp; The corals
lose their aragonite skeleton which disassociated while their polyp
biomass increased fivefold.&nbsp; Moreover, the coral lost its
colonial structure and separated into a multitude of single
polyps.&nbsp; These polyps maintained their reproductive
ability.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>This find has vast implications on our
understanding of coral evolution in light of the fact that marine pH
has shifted dramatically during the earth's history.&nbsp; There
are two major 'reef gaps'- a period in the geological record which is
absent of coral fossils. One occurred during the Permian-Triassic mass
extinction event (251 million years ago) and another occurred during
the Triassic-Jurassic boundary extinction event (206 million years
ago).&nbsp; The lack of fossilized coral in the geological record
during those periods can now be better understood.&nbsp;
Interestingly, molecular clocking has produced a phylogenetic tree that
dates the origin of scleractinian corals at 280 million years ago, yet
there is no such marker in the geological record.&nbsp; Again, our
findings provide an explanation for this incongruency.<strong> </strong></p>
            <p>I am currently expanding this research to a
multitude of species and testing both their physiological and
biochemical reactions to acidification in an attempt to elucidate the
mechanisms behind those very dramatic responses.<strong> </strong></p>
            <p>In addition, we have found that the colony
separation into individual polyps is executed through apoptotic
pathways.&nbsp; This finding is linked to the apoptotic response
that we have discovered is heat-stress related and causes, in many
cases, the annihilation of the whole colony.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Therefore, these studies are providing a broader view of the evolution
of corals in light of their changing environment over their history.</p>
            <p>I am also pursuing questions related to how
acidification impacts phytoplankton in the water column as a means to
create a dependable tool for paleoreconstruction of past climates. A
major determinant of global climate is the atmospheric CO2
concentration. A possible tool for making such assessments is through
the use of various forms of organic phytoplankton remains in the
sediments. These methods have been developed and tested during the last
decade and found to be lacking in several aspects, mainly these methods
did not consider significant physiological characteristics of
phytoplankton such as active carbon transport. I have developed a model
that may be capable of extracting paleo atmospheric CO2 concentration
values from the stable carbon isotope composition of phytoplankton,
considering the typical physiological parameters for each species. The
model is based on both in situ and in vivo measurements. This work is
summarized in two separate manuscripts (Tchernov and Lifshultz <em>in
revision</em>, and Tchernov et al. <em>submitted</em>)
that show the impact of temporal and spatial changes in the water on
the stable carbon isotopes composition of phytoplankton.</p>
            <h3><strong>c. Deep Coral Physiology</strong></h3>
            <p>Most of the world's reefs lie below a depth of 50
meters, and normally continue to 150 meters, particularly in the
Indo-Pacific realm.&nbsp; This means that most of the reef has
never been thoroughly investigated due to technological
limitations.&nbsp; Recently, due to advancements in SCUBA
technology (namely, more accessible and affordable TRIMIX and
rebreather systems)&nbsp; &nbsp;it has become possible to study
the coral reefs at these depths in Eilat.&nbsp; Because this is an
entirely new research area, there is a substantial amount of work
underway analyzing and understanding the basic physiology of the
organisms living in those deep reefs.</p>
            <p>Our findings include the description of a totally
new photosynthetic pathway and organization.&nbsp; Deep corals and
also macroalgae seem to have an extremely low photosynthetic rate and
an almost complete absence of PS1 functional response.&nbsp; In the
case of corals, this makes this symbiosis questionable in terms of the
benefit of the hosts.&nbsp; We believe that the host is actually
contributing carbohydrates to the algal symbionts.&nbsp; If this is
true, it redefines the nature of the symbiosis between corals and their
algal symbionts.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, the photosynthetic organisms that
dwell at those depths have not lost their ability to produce high rates
of photosynthesis at high light intensities, and do not show the
characteristic non-photochemical quenching evident from corals and
macro algae living in shallower depths.</p>
            <p>We are currently in the final stages of fortifying
and retesting these results using different techniques prior to
publishing.&nbsp; Because of the novelty of this research, in the
process of analysis we have developed new techniques and machinery that
enable us to acquire data.&nbsp; For example, we have now a
membrane inlet mass spectrometer that is linked to both a fast
repetition rate fluorometer and a pulse-amplitude modulated
fluorometer, especially modified for this purpose.&nbsp; I believe
that this is a promising new research direction that will be the
foundation for a wide range of studies in the future.</p>
